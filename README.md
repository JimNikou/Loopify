🎵 Loopify - Music Streaming Application

University Project by Team of 4 Students
📖 Project Overview

Loopify is a music streaming application developed as part of our university coursework. The application is built using Java in Android Studio and aims to provide a simplified version of the music streaming experience similar to Spotify.

Our task was to integrate specific APIs, including The AudioDB API and Last.FM API, for music data, album information, artist details, and more. Loopify allows users to browse music, view artist and album details, and stream audio directly from the app.

This project is a collaborative effort from our team of four university students, and it serves as a learning experience to apply our knowledge in Android development, API integration, and UI/UX design.

🌟 Features

Music Streaming: Stream music using public MP3 links via Firebase Storage integration.
Artist and Album Information: Fetch detailed information about artists, albums, and tracks using The AudioDB API and Last.FM API.
User-Friendly Interface: The app's UI is designed to be intuitive and simple, inspired by the user experience of popular music streaming apps.
Search Functionality: Search for your favorite artists, albums, or tracks within the app.
Media Playback Control: Users can play, pause, and stop the music from the app with responsive controls.
